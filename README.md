# GitHub AutoResponder Bot: A Step-by-Step GitHub App Tutorial in Go

## Introduction
Welcome to the **GitHub AutoResponder Bot** tutorial! This project aims to guide you through the process of developing a **GitHub App** using **Go**. We will build an app that automatically responds with a welcome message whenever a new issue is opened in a GitHub repository.

## Learning Approach
The development of this GitHub App will be broken down into multiple steps, following an agile approach. Each step will be implemented as a **feature branch** and merged into the `main` branch once completed. This allows you to explore the evolution of the project by checking out different branches.

### Steps Overview
1. **Project Setup & Documentation**
   - Create this README to describe the tutorialâ€™s purpose and structure.
   
2. **Basic Web Server**
   - Implement a simple HTTP server in Go.
   - Define a handler to receive GitHub webhook events.
   - Log incoming requests without processing them.

3. **Enhancing the Server**
   - Improve reliability with graceful shutdown.
   - Implement structured logging.
   
More steps will be added as we incrementally build the functionality of the GitHub App.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have:
- A basic understanding of Go programming language.
- A GitHub account with access to create GitHub Apps.
- `git` installed for version control.
- `go` installed (Go 1.18+ recommended).
